# Datasets

This folder indexes datasets developed, curated, or synthesized by the lab.

Each dataset should be linked to a **separate dataset repository** that contains:
- data dictionary
- metadata
- provenance and licensing information
- access instructions (if restricted)

Raw or restricted data should **not** be stored in this hub repository.
