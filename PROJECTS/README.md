# Research Projects

This folder indexes all active and completed research projects conducted in the lab.

Each project listed here links to a **dedicated GitHub repository** that contains:
- source code
- data or data access instructions
- documentation
- reproducibility information
- citation metadata

Projects are organized as **standalone repositories**, not as subfolders of this hub.

## For Lab Members

- Add the project link here once the repository is created.
