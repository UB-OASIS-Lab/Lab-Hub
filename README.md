# OASIS Lab (Operations Research & AI for Sustainable Infrastructure)
The vision of the OASIS lab is to advance the field of risk science, leveraging operations research and artificial intelligence to address the complex global challenges related to the resiliency of our sociotechnical systems. The overarching research mission is to better understand, assess, characterize, communicate, manage, and govern risk of the complex societal problems from theoretical and practical perspectives. 

## Research Themes
- development of quantitative models examining systemic/stochastic impacts of various chronic/acute shocks on sociotechnical systems
- development of risk-informed decision models, and
- investigating cost-effective adaptation measures to render our critical infrastructure systems more resilient, sustainable, and intelligent.
